# Youtube Comment Analyzer

Have you ever wondered how Youtube REALLY feels about a video? Are you a content creator who wants to get real feedback about their video, but you don't want to read the comments by trolls? The Youtube Comment Analyzer can help with this problem! Simply put a Youtube URL into the box and the tool will use Natural Language Processing to generate advanced analytics for the provided video, including overall sentiment, a world cloud of repeated key-words, and toxicity level of your comment sections.
